    Bears are large mammals found in mainly the <strong>Northern Hemisphere</strong> and some parts of the Southern Hemisphere. 
    They have thick fur and strong claws with species that range from <strong>Polar bears to Grizzly bear</strong>. 
    Most bears are <strong> omnivores </strong>with diets like <strong> plants, fish, and small animals </strong> 
    although some,like the <strong>polar bear, are more carnivorous.</strong>
